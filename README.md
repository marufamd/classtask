# ClassTask

ClassTask is a task tracking web app for university students.

# Overview
ClassTask is a progressive web app I created to help me manage my coursework in university. I wanted a simple app to track assignment deadlines and
exam dates for different courses that didn't have the bloat of other apps like Notion.

The frontend is a PWA React application written in TypeScript that uses Mantine UI. The backend is a Spring Boot application
written in Java. This was my first time using Spring Boot, and taught me a lot about Object oriented programming and writing
applications in Java.

# Future Develppment
In the future I hope to keep improving upon the app, and to add more features to make the app even better,
such as calendar view support for tasks with deadlines.
